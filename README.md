# R/a/dio, the brand-new Android app!

R/a/dio is a webradio that was founded 7+ years ago with the intention of bringing you a stream of (mostly) high quality anime music, and we keep that up to this day! You can always drop by and visit our website https://r-a-d.io for more information.

### Features

- Listen to R/a/dio!
- Fine-tune the volume in the app to go lower than the lowest volume of Android!
- Adapt to all screens: small phone, big tablet, horizontal, vertical, split screen!
- Start and stop the stream by headphones plugging/unplugging, or with a bluetooth headset!
- Check last played and queued tracks!
- Request any title to the AFK streamer Hanyuu-sama!
- Display and request your favorite tracks! There's even a random-request button (**.ra f**) available!
- Chat in the IRC with the embedded WebIRC!
- Wake up with the sound of R/a/dio with the built-in Alarm Clock feature! Don't worry: if there is no network, it will play a default sound instead.
- Never miss a stream with the Streamer Notification Service! (**Warning: this feature polls the server regularly and consumes battery. It is MUCH MORE RECOMMENDED to register to Hanyuu-sama's updates on Twitter and use the Twitter app. But if for some reason you don't (or can't) use the Twitter App, this should get you covered.**)
- Supports lastFM, LibreFM and Listenbrainz scrobblers with [Pano Scrobbler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble)
- **[v1.1]** Snooze the alarm! You can set up the snooze duration you want, or avoid being tempted and disable snooze altogether. When ringing, a special notification design will display bigger buttons with text instead of icons.
- **[v1.1]** Sleep with the sound of R/a/dio! You can set up a timer to stop the app after any amount of minutes. When the timer approaches, the sound will gradually fade out.

As always, thanks for listening!

Bug fixes:
